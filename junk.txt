Just some junk to put in the repository
I'll edit this later
I'll go read up on cURL and add some commentary as a next step.
cURL is a utility for transfering a data to or from a server using one of the common protocols, i.e.
HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE.  It's meant to work without user
intervention (scripting)
Oops!  Forgot to add a commit comment.
7/6/2017 In Ubuntu 14.04 you have to install open-ssh to enable remote login
Also, xRDP is a (some say) better utility than VNC for remote desktop control.  Install that, too.
Now this file is on firstBranch.  I'll commit this (only changed this line), then do a pull request.
