Learning how to create a new directory and add files to it
#. Now I'm using Notepad++ to edit the files.
#. I've cloned HelloWorld to my local drive, and am watching it with Github Desktop
#. Let's see what happens when I save this file.  It should show up in Github
   Desktop as a changed file, then I can push (commit) it and do a pull request
#. Hmmm...squirrely behavior.  It takes Github a few minutes to sync up with
   the Desktop.  I had to open the master branch, then re-open the Patch2 branch
   to see the pushed file.
